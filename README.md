# paylocity-coding-challenge
Thank you for considering me. I used the strategy design pattern to implement the business logic to calculate the paychecks. This makes the code
more flexable and extensible. It also allows for further discussion about using dependency injection to create other strategies as the business sees fit. 
You could even add a feature to inject the concrete implementations at runtime to add even more flexability (I did this at a previous company)
I added a REST endpoint to create a new employee with dependents so that I could enforce the requirement about the number of domestic partners and spouses an employee could have. 
If I had more time I would have used the Entity Framework and a SQL Lite database for persistant storage.  

Thank you for considering me!
