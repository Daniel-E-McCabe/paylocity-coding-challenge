# paylocity-coding-challenge
Thank you for considering me. I implemented the business logic for the paycheck calculation in the Paycheck
controller. I added a REST endpoint to create a new employee with dependents. If I had more time I would have
used the Entity Framework and a SQL Lite database for persistant storage. I thought about adding a foreign 
key EmployeeID to the Dependents DTO object instead of having a list of dependents in the Employee object 
but figured that in a final version I could still use 2 tables. I'd like to discuss using a strategy pattern 
to manage the deduction business rules. That would allow flexibility when the Product
team wants to add additional business logic to the paycheck calculations. A rules engine could also be created
and put into its own microservice. 

Thank you for considering me!
